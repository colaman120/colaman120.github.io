# Inglourious Basterds

I think it's a fun concept and honestly it's a pretty fun movie. Brad Pitt's character Aldo Raine has a crazy heavy accent which is fun to listen to. That one guy in The Office is in it. So is the villain from Captain America: Winter Soldier. He is, fittingly, also a villain in this movie. 

Not really sure what to think of this one. It was fun. Was it good? It's a little hard for me to say it was good, but I did also watch Schindler's List like 2 weeks ago. That movie was pretty incredible. I wouldn't say that Inglourious Basterds was bad, but I think I had a bit higher expectations because I think my brother thought this movie was really good when I was younger. 

# Moana 2

This is like Moana 1 but with worse music. Maybe Lin Manuel Miranda is the goat.
