# 6/21/25 (SEA 9-4 CUBS)

Tough loss. Cal Raleigh with 2 homers and 3 RBIs, Mitch Garver with 2 homers and 5 RBIs. Genesis Cabrera with another 3 run homer given up. The offense a little dead still despite a warm day and the wind blowing out. This might be along series as long as Cal Raleigh continues to hit those fucking dingers. 

Genesis Cabrera was DFA'd earlier today and the corresponding move was calling up Nate Pearson. Pearson had a rough early season but has apparently but pitching pretty well in AAA recently. Hopefully he can continue that in the majors. 

Matt Shaw has been pretty cold hitting wise. I wonder what the changes between last month and this month have been. Hopefully he can turn that around. 

Also that catch by Matthew Boyd was fucking crazy. I can't believe he didn't fucking die to that comebacker.
