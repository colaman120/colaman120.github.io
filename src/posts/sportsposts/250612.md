Tough loss. I think I'm gonna revise my opinion from yesterday. I think Ben Brown should get sent down when Imanaga comes back. I know I said yesterday that he has really good stuff, but the inconsistency is too big of an issue to ignore at this point. On a team that is contending for the 1 seed in the NL, that kind of inconsistency is something that can't really be something that we're dealing with every five days. I think he could work as a bullpen guy, though at this point I'm not sure that we would want to break up what we have in the bullpen or risk his inconsistencies there either.

Bit of a rough road trip, but we did face Mackenzie Gore, Tarik Skubal, Zack Wheeler, and Jesus Luzardo, all ace level pitchers. Obviously if we want to win it all, we're gonna have to prove that we have what it takes to beat pitchers like these, but this is a bit of an insane gauntlet of starting pitching that I'm not sure most teams face in such a short amount of time. Not to mention that we kept the game against the Tigers during Skubal's start competitive. Shake this road trip off and sweep the Pirates and beat Skenes during his outing.
