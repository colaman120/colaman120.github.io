Great win from the cubs last night. Taillon continues to be a rock for the cubs with 6 1/3 and 2 earned runs. Brad Keller did a good job in allowing only 1 run in the position he was put in. Palencia with a shutout inning followed by a Pressly save. Whenever Pressly comes out, it's hard not to think about that one outing, but since that outing he has yet to give up a run in any of his appearances. It's great to see him back in a position where he feels like he has his stuff and Counsell believes in him to put up the save. 

Two big homers from PCA and Suzuki, the adult and child duo. How the hell does PCA hit home runs so far out of the strike zone? You can't make any mistakes to PCA or he'll blast you out of the park. I mean that ball was like 6 inches above the strike zone. Who else even swings and makes contact on that ball, let alone hits a home run. Seiya hit his ball so insanely hard and it feels like it almost didn't even make it out. He really muscled that ball out against the wind. Really shows the power that he's packing in those thighs. 

It looks kinda close against a kinda bad team in the Pirates, but a win is a win. Today is Paul Skenes day. Beat this super demon and force him out of the game to take over their bullpen.
