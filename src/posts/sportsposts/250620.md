# 6/20/25 (MIL 8-7 CUBS)

That's a tough loss. Taillon had his worst outing in more than a month. He just didn't have his stuff today. I'm willing to overlook an outing or two given the solid work he has been putting out in the past. Genesis Cabrera went out there and proved to me that he should be the first to be DFA'd when Hodge and Imanaga come back. In my last post I talked about what the Cubs should do in regards to Eli Morgan when he comes back, but apparently he's encountered another issue and his rehab/recovery is going to be extended. 

Lots of good stuff to look at this game though. PCA hit his 20th home run, becoming the fastest and youngest Cub to hit 20/20. Flexen and Pomeranz are still electric. Flexen went 3 innings scoreless yesterday. Pomeranz, one inning scoreless. They really held it down and made a comeback possible. The offense looked better than it has in the recent past. I will admit, that ump was calling hella shit for the Cubs. It was honestly fucked up how many calls went our way in the last two innings. But the comeback was definitely possible and it's a good sign to see the Cubs offense start to roll again. Hopefully that can remain true as we face George Kirby today and the Mariners this series as they have an incredible pitching staff. Another test for the Cubs offense and whether or not they can produce against top caliber pitchers.
