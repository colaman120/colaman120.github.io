# Gladiator 2

Paul Mescal might be the most Roman looking actor they could ever find. I really like Denzel's performance in this movie, but I find this Gladiator to be worse than the previous. I think both of the actors playing the emperors are worse than Joaquin Phoenix playing the emperor in Gladiator 1. I think Russell Crowe does a better job as the protagonist in Gladiator 1, though I think its not that far apart. I liked that they brought back the actress to play Lucilla. I don't think there is a moment that hits as hard as Russell Crowe's monologue. Overall, a worse experience. But I don't think its a bad movie. It's fine, it just isn't the original.
