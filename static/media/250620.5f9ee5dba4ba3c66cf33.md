# Kingsman: The Golden Circle

I can't believe they just put the people in cages and stacked them up like Tetris. That was crazy.

# The King's Man

This is like Kingsman but if they took out 75% of the cool action sequences.

# Kpop Demon Hunters

Pretty basic plot, but I think going into this I wasn't really expecting much plotwise. I think the real question that would make this movie good/likeable was if the music was good. I would say that they accomplished that task. They got Jihyo, Jeongyeong, and Chaeryeong from TWICE for one of the songs. Even outside of the one TWICE song, all the other songs are pretty good. And I like the artstyle of the characters. Decently funny too.
