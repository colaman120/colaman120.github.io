Damn that sucked. I think the Cubs did a good job dealing with Skenes. He only pitched 5 innings. It's okay that they didnt score on Skenes, but when you have 4 innings of relief pitching from the Pirates, as one of the best teams in baseball you should probably be scoring on the Pirates bullpen. This is kinda what I said yesterday when I was worried about only scoring 3 on the Pirates. Even though they won, it feels like they should score way more. Seemed like a cold and wet day at Wrigley yesterday but you still need to find a way to score. That's what the Pirates did. Drew Pomeranz walking the first two batters in extras wasn't great either.
