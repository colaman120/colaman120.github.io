# Andor

I feel like I have so many things to say about this show but I suck at writing. This show (along with a couple movies) are the pieces of media that inspired me to start writing about my feelings following a show. I mean where do I even start? This is my favorite show of all-time. Take that with a grain of salt as I haven't really watched a ton of TV shows. 

Let's start with season one. The first three episodes are a touch slow. It's an obviously necessary part of the show as it sets Andor off on his journey with Luthen, shows the connection between Andor and his mother Maarva, and I think crucially, albeit a little stretchily,  connects to a line in Rogue One in which Andor states that he had been in the fight since he was six years old. It also introduces us to Syril, an important side character who sets everything off to begin with, a host of other people important to Andor, and his adoptive home planet Ferrix that we come back to later in the show. The flashbacks to Andor's actual home planet, Kenari, are just for the most part uninteresting and take away from the more interesting plot of Andor trying to escape from corporate clutches with the aid of Bix's buyer Luthen. It also connects to the plot of Andor trying to find his sister, which we never come back to after these first three episodes. These first three episodes are some of the weakest in Andor but they are necessary to the start of the series to introduce us to the people we will be seeing in the future.

The next three episodes, episodes 4-6, are incredible. Andor is paid by Luthen to assist in a heist of an imperial outpost. Andor is joined by multiple people in this heist, including Vel, Nemik, Cinta, Skeen, Taramyn, and Gorn. 


In one scene during this period, while the group is practicing the steps of the heist with Andor, being the late addition that he is, a TIE fighter screams overhead and forces them to put a pause to their practice. This is such a cool scene because it's the first time a single TIE fighter has been used so menacingly. In the movies we see plenty of TIE fighters as they battle against rebel X-wings in space. In those scenes, the power of the TIE fighters is never really conveyed in the ways that they should be. But when just one flies over Andor and his group, you understand that this one fighter could wipe out their entire operation without breaking a sweat if it so chose to do. 


We're also introduced to Mon Mothma, a senator in the Galatic Empire trying to do her best to combat the rising tide of imperialism.
