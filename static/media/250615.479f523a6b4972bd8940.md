# 6/15/25 (PIT 1-2 CUBS)

It wasn't a pretty win but it will play. Matthew Boyd is just lights out man. This dude is one of the best signings of the offseason for sure. So consistent with excellent stuff. He's also got that disgusting pickoff move which honestly borders on a balk but the umps don't call it so we take those. Good job by the bullpen to come throuugh for 3 scoreless innings. Pressly, Pomeranz, and then Palencia for the save.

The offense has been a bit anemic as of late. I will say that the Cubs have been through a bit of a pitching gauntlet and the Pirates have better pitching than their record would indicate. Hopefully that go-ahead homer by Dansby can reignite something in his at bats.

I will say though, that is not a game that the Cubs win last year. I think this is still a better team by far and them taking close wins is a show of both a better bullpen, better hitting, and better mentality overall. In a 162 game season you just gotta take any wins you can and look to improve the next day.

Something I want to shout out from yesterday that I didn't is that Cade Horton had his best outing yet. Scoreless appearance for the first time and really went toe to toe with Skenes, who will probably win the NL Cy Young Award. Really promising stuff and I hope he has the consistency to keep up. Listening to his post game interviews, I think he has the mindset to do so.
